#### Implementation of a computational functional model of recovery after stroke that establishes a closed loop between arm use, functional recovery, and cortical reorganization (Han et al., 2008; Hidaka et al., 2012; Schweighofer et al., 2009). We extended and applied this model to formulate predictions about the clinical outcome of different therapy combinations based on contraint induced movement therapy and reinforcement.
