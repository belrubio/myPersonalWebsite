#### In this project we developed a wearable bracet device to validate an accelerometers-based measurement of arm use and a method to promote arm use based on vibration feedback. Our results suggest that frequent exposure to direct feedback about arm use promotes the integration of the paretic limb in the performance of instrumental activities of daily living (iADLs).
